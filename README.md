# Movie Recommender 
This is a simple movie recommender built using the concept of word vectors, cosine similarity. TFIDF vectors are used to create the vectors for each movie. 

You can check out the app [here](https://movie-recommender-taki-hasan.streamlit.app/)

The whole process of building this app can be divided into three parts - 

1. Cleaning and Vectorization. Code regarding that can be found 
2. Using similarity search to create a rank table 
3. Interface building

Code regarding first two steps can be found [here](https://github.com/Sherlock-221BBS/Movie-Recommender/blob/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System.ipynb)

the code for the interface and the relevant functions can be found in the ``main.py`` file.
